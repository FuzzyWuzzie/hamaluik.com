summary: I somewhat recently came across AutoTileGen by Pixelatto—a tool for rapidly creating “blob pattern” tilesets from just three input images. It seems like a pretty good tool, at least for a quick rough-in of tiles. It just has one major flaw—the tilesheet that it outputs is all mangled.

I somewhat recently came across [AutoTileGen](http://autotilegen.com/) by [Pixelatto](http://pixelatto.com/)—a tool for rapidly creating ["blob pattern"](http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=166) tilesets from just three input images. It seems like a pretty good tool, at least for a quick rough-in of tiles. It just has one major flaw—the tilesheet that it outputs is all mangled:

    <figcaption>How am I supposed to use this?</figcaption>
</figure>

So I created a simple tool in Python to covert the above output in something a little more friendly:

    <figcaption>Much better!</figcaption>
